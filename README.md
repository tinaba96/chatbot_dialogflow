# chatbot_dialogflow

## Overview
I developed a chatbot using a platform called dialogflow developed by google and used an API which translate the message you asked to this chatbot. Also, I used an API which enable the chatbot to reply us the weather forecast if you ask the chatbot with time and the location that you need the weather forecast from. I used the fulfillment from [here](https://github.com/juanantoniofm12/fulfillment-webhook-translate-python) for the translate API and the fulfillment from [here](https://github.com/dialogflow/fulfillment-weather-python) for weather foecast API.


## Instruction
Dialogflow has an `Intents` item, an `Entity` item, and many other items. You can set keywords in `Entity` and decide how to respond or how to react to the user's words in Intents. In addition, `Fulfillment` in Dialogflow allows you to call information from outside.





## What is Dialogflow
Dialogflow is a natural language understanding (NLU) platform developed by Google. It allows developers to build conversational interfaces, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, that can understand and respond to user inputs in a human-like manner. Dialogflow uses advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret user queries and generate appropriate responses.

## What is Fuilfillment
Fulfillment, in the context of chatbots and virtual assistants, refers to the process of generating and delivering a response to a user's query or request. When a user interacts with a chatbot or virtual assistant, the system needs to interpret the user's input, determine the appropriate response, and deliver it back to the user.
